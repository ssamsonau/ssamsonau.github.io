      <description>There is a lot of information on Data Science on Internet. On this page I summarize the most essential things you would need to know to start working on real projects. The rest you can figure out on the way. This page is intentionally short (relativelly).
BooksR for Data ScienceAn Introduction to Statistical LearningData Science for BusinessTools, Installation and updatinginstallr packagefor updating R to a newer version (from RGui do installr::updateR())installing Rtools, git, ImageMagick, etc.</description>

      <description>A short review of some methods allowing to create animations in R is presented bellow.
Available optionslibrary(animation)saveGIF (relies on ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick)saveVideosaveMoviesaveHTMLother functions heremagick package for ImageMagick use in R
gganimateadditional use of package tweenr makes a result smotheranimated maps

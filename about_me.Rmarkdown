* For my Master's degree (theoretical Physics) I was playing with a behavior of a particle transitioning between potential wells. This was addressed using computer simulations in Matlab and Wolfram Mathematica.

* Later I got interested in psychology, took some training, and went to work in IT, playing with algorithms for stock market trading (mostly using C).

* For PhD degree (Physics) I was working on studying a growth mechanism of graphene-like (1 layer carbon film) films on a quartz substrate. Part of work - experiment, part - computer simulation using Quantum Espresso and CUNY high performance computer center resources.

* After teaching Physics at City University of New York for several years I formed an impression, that introducing Physics to students at a college level may be much less efficient comparing to do doing that at a High School (I was introduced to Physics at 9th grade, and had some basis for comparison). 

    * So I went to work at a High School to teach Physics. I focused on labs for core classes (algebra- and calculus-based) and on Quantum Mechanics
    * It appeared that having an opportunity to introduce research as part of a Physics curriculum is really beneficial for general kids' understanding on how Physics works
    * At the high school I was (and am) working on 1) teaching kids stuff 2) preparing them to do research 3) mentoring them in their research activities
    * I did organize and do mentor lab on micro- and nano- technology
    * Quantum Mechanics class follows a college level book, starting with Dirac notation at the beginning - much better way comparing to wave mechanics (from my teaching experience)
    
* While teaching Physics I also started learning/doing Data Science. 
    * Coursera classes, projects on Kaggle, books, projects, etc 
    * In 2016 I and a colleague [organized a training program](https://www.ket-labs.com) for PhDs at Columbia University  
    * In 2017 I started teaching a full year class of Data Science for kids at a High School (see [teaching page](/teaching)).
    * I also spend some time working as a consultant at NYC firms.
    
* At this moment I continue to teach Physics (theory, experiment, computer simulations), and Data Science, while also doing some projects and consulting as time allows
